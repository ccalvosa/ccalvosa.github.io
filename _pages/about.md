Heey, I am Carlos!!  

Now I'm inmmersed doing my PhD dissertation on Tropical Transitions in North Atlantic. We are looking the atmospheric energy spectra, synoptic and mesoscale synoptic features with ERA5 reanalysis, high-resolution NWP models and future climate models (EC-EARTH). Furthermore, I'm interested in severe convective storms in Spain, specially supercell spectrum (hail, non-hail, classic, tornadic, etc).
