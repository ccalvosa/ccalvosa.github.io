Carlos Calvo-Sancho has an international PhD in Physics at the University of Valladolid. He currently is a postdoc researcher -Período de Orientación Postdoctoral- since 2024 at the University of Valladolid in the Department of Applied Mathematics in the Faculty of Computer Science. His main research interests are tropical meteorology, severe weather and its link to climate change, especially supercells, hail and convectively extreme wind gusts. He has published 12 peer-reviewed articles in Q1 and Q2 and 2 chapters of books and proceedings, with a h-index of 4 and > 50 citations; and contributed with > 25 oral/poster presentations in national/international conferences (1 solicited). He participated in 2 national research projects as predoc and postdoc. Calvo-Sancho has been awarded with 2 young scientists prizes; granted with 1 fellowship (FPI); visitor in 2 institutions in Spain (AEMET and Climatoc-Lab CIDE-CSIC) and in 1 international institution (NCAR, US). Finally, he is one of the creators of the Spanish Supercell and Hail citizen science project, recollecting current and old supercell and hail reports in Spain, which is disseminate in @Supercelulas. 

The main aim of his research line has been to study cyclones with tropical characteristics (e.g., tropical transitions, medicanes, etc.), supercells, large hail and convectively extreme wind gusts under a changing climate: 

•	Tropical transitions in the North Atlantic: in this research line, the phase where a baroclinic cyclone becomes a tropical cyclone was analyzed using observational and reanalysis data. The results obtained were transferred to assess the potential hazard of tropical cyclones in the Iberian Peninsula, Canarian Islands and the Western European coast. 

•	Supercells and large hail in Spain: in this research line, supercells and large hail reports are collected and ingested in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results obtained were transferred to (i) develop a supercell and large hail spatiotemporal climatology, (ii) in which convective environments are favorable, and (iii) assess potential risks related to these extreme meteorological events. 

•	Numerical modeling, wind kinetic energy spectra and storyline approach: in this research line, in collaboration with experts from the Spanish Meteorological Agency, this work was performed to increase the ability in very high-resolution (500-m) in the HARMONIE-AROME model. For the work, (i) we analyze the wind kinetic energy spectra in ERA5 and HARMONIE-AROME in multiple tropical transition events to assess if the energy in mesoscale ranges is being captured, and (ii) a novel attribution methodology is being implemented to evaluate how the actual anthropogenic climate change is affecting in extreme convective events (such as the giant hail in Girona 2022, the Mediterranean Derecho in 2022 or extreme Valencia’s floods in 2024).
